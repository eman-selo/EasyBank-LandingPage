This is a solution to the Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor. The project focuses on building a modern, professional, and fully responsive financial services interface.

🚀 Key Technical Implementation:
Dynamic Navigation: Implemented a functional mobile menu using JavaScript that toggles icons (Hamburger/Close) and includes a smooth overlay effect.

Modern Layouts: Utilized CSS Grid for the features and articles sections, and Flexbox for the navigation and footer.

Responsive Images: Managed complex background positioning (Desktop vs. Mobile backgrounds) using CSS absolute positioning and media queries.

UI/UX Focus: Implemented hover states for buttons (gradients) and social icons to enhance user interaction.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Semantic HTML5

Custom CSS Properties (Variables)

JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

Mobile-First Workflow

💡 What I Learned:
This project was a great exercise in handling complex background images and ensuring that the navigation remains accessible on smaller screens. Refactoring the CSS to handle the transition between the desktop bg-intro-desktop.svg and the mobile version was a key highlight of this project.
