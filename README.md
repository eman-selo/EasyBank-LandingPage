This small project is the result of my effort to apply the fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS**.
Throughout the course, I paid special attention to the principle of **Responsive Design**, and I applied those skills while building this page.
The project reflects the beginning of my web development journey and is open to future development and additions.
